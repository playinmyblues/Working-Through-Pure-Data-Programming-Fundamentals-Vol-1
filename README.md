# Working-Through-Pure-Data-Programming-Fundamentals-Vol-1
This is a collection of Pure Data patches that have been created to help learn the material presented in the book "Pure Data Programming Fundamentals: Patching, effects, sound synthesis," by Maurizio Di Berardino. Comments should be found throughout the patches to help with understanding.

The general format for patch names is to include an abbreviation for the word "page," "p," followed by the page number at the beginning of the patch name. The rest is often a description of the patch.

For the first patch posted here, the material I was reading at the time was around page 36 and it was regarding the use of externals in Pure Data. It also talked about how to add objects to reference individual parts of external libraries. I provided a lot of comments in the patch to describe what I have done.
