#X text 60 21 This Pd patch is simply to experiment with the topic of adding only a small number of patches from a Pd external or part of a library of Pd patches. The larger goal is adding a whole external which is usually done in the Deken app within Pd. But you can download others' externals and add them manually which is described around page 36 of the book "Pure Data programming fundamentals: Patching \, effects \, sound synthesis \, " by Maurizio Di Berardino. Using this method below \, I have given myself access to one patch that I made and placed in a folder in the Pd_work folder named below. I am not sure how to get the patch referenced in a way that it runs directly in this window but that is not important at this point.;

#X text 66 332 The author also says that this is useful is you want to take a small number of patches from different libraries to a performance where you cannot use your own computer. Place them in a folder on a USB drive and take that with you. HOWEVER \, you need to keep the patches in a folder relative to the patch you are running. This all works out if you keep them in the same folder and the external patch files are in a folder relative to the patch running. ********************************************************* *IF you want to add the patches as externals as an external that runs without the declare object above \, you need to add it using the PATH option in the Preferences. You might also need to use the STARTUP flag. See the instructions around p36 in the book.;
#X obj 541 343 print_random_0_to_30;
#X text 552 370 print_random_0_to_9 demos the first use of the Example_external folder and addition of that as an external that is added in a relative folder. It uses the declare object in this patch. ************************************************************ print_random_0_to_100 is a demo of an external added in the Preferences of Pd. To make sure folders were added properly \, I named the folder for this external as Example_external_2. ************************************************************ print_random_0_to_30 is a demo to confirm that the declare object used in this patch.;
#X text 655 39 P38 - Open up the Help file on the web: the example that is shown does not work. The bang object will not connect to the [pd open-manual] object. And the open-manual object just opens up another Pd patch called open-manual. Try it.;

#X text 1007 258 And then there is the other way to refernece a patch which is to create it and store it in the same folder as the patch that is referencing it.;

#X restore 901 720 pd new_reference;
#X text 359 822 How this works is that you create the object using the Cmd-1 key combination to create a regular object. Type in the term "pd name_of_reference_file" and it will create an object. And when you click off of this new object it will create a new window with the name "name_of_reference_file" or whatever you put in between the quotes. Do not enter the quotes. See to the right for example(s). In this new window you enter in your Pd code. When things are created correctly you can save the Pd patch in the regular patch you have created and it will save this other patch somehow within it. When the other patch is created correctly \, it will have an inlet to which you can connect the bang object. Click it and the Help file you have referenced will pop up. ************************************************************One thing to note with this setup is that the reference used in the directory provided in the other patch window can be relative or explicit. Relative is used when the example patch is created and the documentation for the Help file is contained in a directory in a relative way to the patch. But when you create your own patches and want to reference a Help file you should probably use the explicit reference that provides all of the directory information in case you do not know the relative path or your directory changes in which you keep your patch.;

#X text 1035 621 When using this method to create other patches to reference in Pd \, there is no need \, as far as I know \, to give it a .pd file extension. Note that this object to the left has an inlet. There is a Pd object in its patch that creates that inlet.;
#X text 1047 723 This object to the left is an empty patch and has nothing in it.;

#X text 337 537 AFTER SOME SEARCHING AND CLICKING AMONG HELP FILES AND THE LIKE \, I FOUND A PART OF A PATCH IN THE 01.scalars.pd help file which brings you to the html-reference file which resides in the Pd app. So here is that. However \, just making an object that has the term "pd html-reference" in it is not enough. I am working through the process to make it work and describing it. The scalars Help file is part of the Data Structures Help section.;
#X text 348 674 It really helps to make notes as you go along in making these patches. It really is much like writing code in text in a text editor or IDE. If you do not make notes along the way \, it gets harder to figure out what you were doing at different points in the patches. I forgot where it was that I saw the Help patch for scalars. But I made note of the patch name so I searched the app folder for it to find it. It turns out it was not part of what I thought it was so noting the file name helped.;
