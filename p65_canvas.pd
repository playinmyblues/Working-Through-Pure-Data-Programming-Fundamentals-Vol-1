#X text 500 47 This is the Canvas element. See page 65 in the bood for more details. However \, I think there are a couple of things worth mentioning that will help me in the future to learn how to use this. There is not much content on it at this point. When you create the object and place it \, if you right-click and select Properties when the cursor is over the squre in the upper left corner \, you will get Properties that allow you to change the label \, the colour of the background \, and the colour of the label text. You can also change the overall size of the canvas and the side of the square in the upper left corner. If you right click on the main body of the canvas and select Properties \, you get a different Canvas Properties dialog box that contains a few things such as "Scale \, " "Appearance on parent patch \, " and "Range and size" sections. The canvas allows for easier ID of sections of a patch and some other functionality. I will learn more later. The book mentions 2.14.4.;
