#X text 231 103 To use this particular list to the left in the way it is patched \, you have to put the patch in run mode as you cannot type anything in it directly in edit mode. Then you press enter for that to take. It will print it then. You can click on the [bang] and it will print it again. The book gives more on how to use a list.;

#X text 285 212 The [pack f f f] obejct has a behaviour where the object feeding into the left most inlet determines when the information is sent. It sends only when that inlet is activated. You can activate the other two inlets all you want but it only sends out the information once the left most inlet is activated. The list sends out information whenever it is changed.;

#X text 749 117 You can enter text into the list when the patch is in edit more. You just have to press the Cmd key and click-click to do so. Cmd-click-click. It is the click-click that puts you into the edit field of the list. Then type. If you use the Cmd-click-click option on a number box and move the cursor for the number box feeding into the left most inlet of [pack f f f] \, that will change the list and in the case of the part of the patch to the lower left corner \, send that to print. ALSO \, in edit mode \, if Cmd-click is used \, then press enter \, the contents of the list are sent. The same is true in run mode - click to select the list \, press enter to send.;
